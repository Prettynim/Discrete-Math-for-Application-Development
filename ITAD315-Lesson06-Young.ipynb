    "This project generates a Koch Anti-Snowflake, a creative variation of the classic Koch Snowflake fractal. Unlike the original Koch Snowflake, which adds outward “peaks” to each line segment, this version forms inward-pointing bumps, producing a concave, star-like shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "RECURSION_DEPTH: Determines the number of recursive subdivisions for each line segment. Higher values create more intricate and detailed patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIDE_LENGTH: Sets the initial length of each side of the triangular snowflake.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Function: koch_anti_curve\n",
    "This function draws a single segment of the fractal recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: When the depth is 0, the turtle simply draws a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Case: Each line segment is divided into three equal parts. The middle section is replaced with an inward-pointing “bump” using a series of right and left turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Draw the first third of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn right 60° and draw the second segment (initiates the inward peak).\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn left 120° and draw the third segment (forms the inverted bump).\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn right 60° and draw the final segment to align with the original direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Function: draw_koch_anti_snowflake\n",
    "This function assembles the full Anti-Snowflake by connecting three Koch Anti-Curves into an equilateral triangle. After completing each side, the turtle turns 120° to form the triangular shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Turtle Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The turtle screen is set to 800x800 pixels with a black background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turtle, named artist, draws in cyan and is positioned so that the final fractal appears centered on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The program recursively draws the Anti-Snowflake using the specified recursion depth and side length.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each recursive iteration, the line segments subdivide further, creating the characteristic concave fractal edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The final fractal is symmetric, with inward-pointing triangular indentations instead of outward spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each small section mirrors the overall shape, showcasing the fractal principle of self-similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is both mathematically interesting and visually striking, illustrating how simple recursive rules can produce complex patterns."
